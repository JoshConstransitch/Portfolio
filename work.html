                <p> During High School, I worked at a grocery store called David's. In my time there I started as a bag boy, then a stocker, eventully moved on to being a cashieer and reviewed for Managment. That's when they were bought out by Brookshire's</p>
                <p>From Brookshire's I moved on to SpaceX as a contractor, attended school for HVAC/R Engineering, spent two-years as a Comercial service Tech. Now in 2021, I decided to attend Truecoders and venture into Web-Development.</p>
